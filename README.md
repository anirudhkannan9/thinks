 * Books are famously padded w/ non-essential stuff. Maybe the padding (inadvertently?), is a way to force spaced repetition while consuming the book. Instead of a book being a few essays that can be digested in an afternoon and then promptly forgotten, it's essays + padding, which reifies the contents in one's memory over a few days/weeks via SR. cf. Michael Nielsen's essay on long-term memory & Anki: http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html

 * Variable rewards are more addictive than predictable rewards. Perhaps one reason smartphones caught on is because they were great, but not perfect - there'd always be e.g. unpredictability re: whether you'd hit the right key on the keyboard. BCIs will presumably be far more addictive, but presumably for different reasons - I don't expect them to have this feature. 

 * Pfizer being a more desired vaccine than Moderna. Pfizer being thought of as the 'iPhone of vaccines'. Because of fricatives (Pfizer vs moderna). Cf. Anthony Shore Twitter, The Atlantic: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/04/pfizer-gang-and-sadness-vaccine-culture/618755/

 * It's perhaps intuitive that BCIs will obsolete e.g. translators, because anyone who speaks language X will be able to express any of their thoughts to people who don't speak language X. It's tempting to think this way -- but is it true? E.g. "I just think it's funny how..." -- funny phrase, especially in context. But can you really convey the exact same idea via a BCI? The hint (or more) of annoyance, the fact that it may be tongue in cheek, the beating of a dead horse -- really conveyable? Counterview: yes, it's just a matter of conveying more data, associated with more aspects/dimensions of the situation (i.e. not just lexical data, but also psychological data, contextual data). This is already done implicitly by the phrase + context diad, so a matter of making that explicit.

 * Is all great art prescriptive, rather than descriptive?

 * Most creators have a business that looks like the business the platform wants you to have: most Instagrammers have a brand licensing or partnership business, while most YouTubers have an AdSense business. 

* How are the platforms I use causing me to adopt their incentives? How are their incentives different from mine?

 * From a YT comment on a video of Thiel speaking in Miami in late 2021: "On psychology Girard said in a way that it misses the mark.  It seeks to psychologize the individual when what is at play is a relationship.  Even at the lowest level the relationship between the psychologist and patient."

* Img: https://i.redd.it/jyfc2gyya9i51.jpg . "Why I have trust issues". Different tape measures showing different lengths corresponding to an inch. My suspicion -- most people would probably think that the longer inch is the actual inch. Is my suspicion true? Why or why not?

* Counterpoint to "just start": Reading something (before the event) that changes your epistemological attitudes/reflexive interpretations of events is more than worth it. Why? Epistemology is fundamental (why is epistemology fundamental?). Reflexive interpretation (== perception) is fundamental (I hope I don't need to warrant that perception is fundamental).

* [Tim Ferriss' favourite kind of market](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPleJbpqbwc): v precisely defined, easy to target, price-insensitive, high-end market. Can make mistakes if you have tech + design chops.

* Per the [Atlantic](https://outline.com/cJs5Fe). Dating apps don't provide dates, or access. They provide a feeling of possibility.
 
* Cate Blanchett [uncanny valley charity ad - blinking](https://imgur.com/MGP9p41). It looks real because of the half-blink/rlly rapid blink

* [Asymmetric countermeasures](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-block-an-infrared-helicopter/answer/Franklin-Veaux?ch=10&oid=331203225&share=a3ad3d73&srid=TxcX&target_type=answer): "Expensive FLIR cameras defeated by cheap space blankets, expensive facial recognition software defeated by cheap makeup, expensive gait detection systems defeated by a rock in your shoe."

* "What did you learn from X past experience?" This question is difficult, because you don't know what the distribution for that kind of experience looks like. Can you draw a valid inference without that knowledge? E.g. you have a grp project at school, and one of the students is way older than the rest of the class (~26 vs avg age of ~21). You decide to work with him on the thesis that he'll be older and far more mature, organized, and diligent than the other students. He turns out not to be. Was he an anomaly? Presumably? But you can't know without knowing what the distribution looks like. Do you discard your (ostensibly defensible) thesis based on this experience? Casual conversations + job interviews would suggest we do. Orthogonal question --  is what we say in those contexts (convos, interviews) truly reflective of the epistemics that happen under the hood?

* Context is a confluence of factors. Simultaneous presence of several factors. This is obvious -- literally the definition -- but also easy to forget.

* “Creative Cum” -another edgy technique I teach my clients is to use their orgasms for magic & creation. Every time you ‘come’ your mind gets soft like plasticine, it becomes ready for shaping with autosuggestion. In fact an orgasm is a very intense trance state where you can consciously lay down anchors linked to outcomes you want. Why waste such a good opportunity to embed some visions of your desired future? **If you want a new job, imagine your dream job while you’re climaxing. If you want a new car, imagine that.** Whatever you want, visualize that at peak pleasure **-always in 1st person & always in present tense.** [- Annie Lalla](https://annielalla.com/sex-deeper-love-money/)
