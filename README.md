 * Books are famously padded w/ non-essential stuff. Maybe the padding (inadvertently?), is a way to force spaced repetition while consuming the book. Instead of a book being a few essays that can be digested in an afternoon and then promptly forgotten, it's essays + padding, which reifies the contents in one's memory over a few days/weeks via SR. cf. Michael Nielsen's essay on long-term memory & Anki: http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html

 * Variable rewards are more addictive than predictable rewards. Perhaps one reason smartphones caught on is because they were great, but not perfect - there'd always be e.g. unpredictability re: whether you'd hit the right key on the keyboard.

 * Pfizer being a more desired vaccine than Moderna. Pfizer being thought of as the 'iPhone of vaccines'. Because of fricatives (Pfizer vs moderna). Cf. Anthony Shore Twitter, The Atlantic: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/04/pfizer-gang-and-sadness-vaccine-culture/618755/

 * It's perhaps intuitive that BCIs will obsolete e.g. translators, because anyone who speaks language X will be able to express any of their thoughts to people who don't speak language X. It's tempting to think this way -- but is it true? E.g. "I just think it's funny how..." -- funny phrase, especially in context. But can you really convey the exact same idea via a BCI? The hint (or more) of annoyance, the fact that it may be tongue in cheek, the beating of a dead horse -- really conveyable? Counterview: yes, it's just a matter of conveying more data, associated with more aspects/dimensions of the situation (i.e. not just lexical data, but also psychological data, contextual data). This is already done implicitly by the phrase + context diad, so a matter of making that explicit.

 * Is all great art prescriptive, rather than descriptive?

 * Most creators have a business that looks like the business the platform wants you to have: most Instagrammers have a brand licensing or partnership business, while most YouTubers have an AdSense business. 

 * From a YT comment on a video of Thiel speaking in Miami in late 2021: "On psychology Girard said in a way that it misses the mark.  It seeks to psychologize the individual when what is at play is a relationship.  Even at the lowest level the relationship between the psychologist and patient."

* Img: https://i.redd.it/jyfc2gyya9i51.jpg . "Why I have trust issues". Different tape measures showing different lengths corresponding to an inch. My suspicion -- most people would probably think that the longer inch is the actual inch. Is this true? Why or why not?

* Counterpoint to "just start": Reading something (before the event) that changes your epistemological attitudes/reflexive interpretations of events is more than worth it. Why? Epistemology is fundamental (why is epistemology fundamental?). Reflexive interpretation (== perception) is fundamental (I hope I don't need to warrant that perception is fundamental).
* [Tim Ferriss' favourite kind of market](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPleJbpqbwc): v precisely defined, easy to target, price-insensitive, high-end market. Can make mistakes if you have tech + design chops.
* Per the [Atlantic](https://outline.com/cJs5Fe). Dating apps don't provide dates, or access. They provide a feeling of possibility.  
* Cate Blanchett [uncanny valley charity ad - blinking](https://imgur.com/MGP9p41). It looks real because of the half-blink/rlly rapid blink
